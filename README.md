# EKG_Arrhythmia_Detection_Machine_Learning_Model

Arrhythmias are abnormal heart rates at any point in time, outside of the 60-100 BPM range. Though many are insignificant, like when someone is exercising, whether 
arrhythmias are chronic or not is a good measure of overall cardiac health. The most common way heart arrhythmias are diagnosed is with an electrocardiogram (EKG), 
which displays the electrical activity of each heartbeat. Each segment of an EKG that represents a heartbeat can be divided into several different components, including 
P-waves, QRS-complexes, and T-waves. Based on user input, which is comprised of numerical values that reflect features of the previously mentioned components of the EKG, 
our machine learning model was built to determine which of these components is most important in determining arrhythmia. Machine learning models can do this with more 
accuracy than human brains can, since they are more effective at recording, storing, and making insights from the data. The potential for an efficient diagnostic model 
for this heart condition is high; though a machine learning program is only as efficient as the range and quality of training data that the programmer enters, it is not 
limited to the way human brains are (emotional reasoning, faulty memory, etc.). Devoid of human error, developing a model that can efficiently record and classify 
arrhythmias with an EKG as an input can be of great use in the early prevention of more serious cardiac conditions, like strokes or myocardial infarctions.
